# SQL Project: Airbnb Data Exploration in Singapore Area

## Introduction
Who doesn't know Airbnb?? You and billions of people in this world surely know that Airbnb is an affordable accommodation platform that empowers hosts to rent out their properties to guests who want to stay. On Airbnb, users can choose various accommodation options such as private houses, apartments, villas, and even private rooms in other people's homes. Airbnb users also enjoy the flexibility of choice in customizing their stay experience like staying in the center of the city or experiencing life in the suburbs.  Airbnb also provides guests with access to design their trips according to preferences and budgets. As a pioneer in the online travel industry, Airbnb has become an integral part of how people explore the world, embracing the spirit of adventure, and celebrating the diversity of places to stay across the continent.

## Dataset Overview
This dataset was provided by my teaching mentor to analyze and processing data to produce insights that are expected as a basis for making business decisions. The dataset consists of the following attributes:
1. Table 1: listings = The first data contains a list of Airbnb listings in Singapore
2. Table 2: reviews = The second data contains historical order/rent data per listing in Singapore from 1 January 2018 to 22 September 2022
3. Table 3: neighborhood = The third data contains mapping of the Singapore region based on its neighbourhood
4. Table 4: room_type = The fourth data contains the types of rooms available in homestay areas in Singapore

## Problem Statement
The Airbnb company appointed a data analyst team to conduct data exploration to gain useful insight for market expansion purposes in the Singapore region. The specific insight they required is as follows:
1. Total listing: Find out the number of homestays in Singapore
2. Total review: Find out the total number of visitors staying at the homestay from 2018 to 2022.
3. Listing Distribution: Find out the number of homestays in Central Region, East Region, North-East Region, West Region, and North Region. With this insight, we can find out which regions have the highest number of homestays.
4. Room Type: Analyzing every type of room. In this section, the analyst is expected to identify the total number of operated homestay room types and find the number of guests over the last five years.
5. Price Unit: After analyzing the room types, the analyst can be to determine the pricing of each room type by understanding a price range and average price.
6. Total Revenue: Calculates the overall income by all listings based on the rented room type. This exploration will enable us to identify what types of rooms have generated the most revenue over the last five years.

## Summary
From the overall analysis that has been made, Entire home/apt is the room type that dominates 56% of the market share across Singapore, with the number of guests staying in homestays of this type reaching 33.654 guests in the last five years (2018â€“2022). Apart from that, Entire home/apt has an average price of 111 SGD with a price range that varies from 20 SGD (lowest price) to 12.494 SGD (highest price), which is more varied than other three room types. If we look from revenue perspective, Entire home/apt has recorded revenue of 100.206.370 SGD during the period from 2018 to 2022 which is much higher than Private room, Hotel room, and Shared room.
