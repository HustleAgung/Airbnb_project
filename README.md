# SQL Project: Airbnb Data Exploration in Singapore Area

## Introduction
Who doesn't know Airbnb?? You and billions of people in this world surely know that Airbnb is an affordable accommodation platform that empowers hosts to rent out their properties to guests who want to stay. On Airbnb, users can choose various accommodation options such as private houses, apartments, villas, and even private rooms in other people's homes. Airbnb users also enjoy the flexibility of choice in customizing their stay experience like staying in the center of the city or experiencing life in the suburbs.

As a pioneer in the online travel industry, Airbnb has become an integral part of how people explore the world, embracing the spirit of adventure, and celebrating the diversity of places to stay across the continent.
