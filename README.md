## Problem Statement
The Airbnb company appointed a data analyst team to conduct data exploration to gain useful insight for market expansion purposes in the Singapore region. The specific insight they required is as follows:
1. Total listing: Find out the number of homestays in Singapore
2. Total review: Find out the total number of visitors staying at the homestay from 2018 to 2022.
3. Listing Distribution: Find out the number of homestays in Central Region, East Region, North-East Region, West Region, and North Region. With this insight, we can find out which regions have the highest number of homestays.
4. Room Type: Analyzing every type of room. In this section, the analyst is expected to identify the total number of operated homestay room types and find the number of guests over the last five years.
5. Price Unit: After analyzing the room types, the analyst can be to determine the pricing of each room type by understanding a price range and average price.
